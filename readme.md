# üß† Spring AI Integration - Recipe Suggestion API

This project is a small REST API built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI**, which allows recipe generation using language models like OpenAI (GPT). The application exposes several endpoints to interact with an AI model that suggests recipes based on ingredients and other parameters.
